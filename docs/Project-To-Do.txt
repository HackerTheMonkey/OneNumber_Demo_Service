Dev plan

19-jan-2011 (DONE)
------------------ 

- GUI structure and layout design and development, this just includes the menu structure and the registration of the intents, services, etc... The development and the inclusion of the service feature will be included later on.

Progress note: The development of the main GUI structure has been completed, but we need to finalize the click event listeners development. It is more convenient to have the config client constructing a message object and sending that message object over the http protocol when the user clicks a config submission and update button, this is in contrast to the location update procedure which is basically consists of a background service that is not visibile to the user.
